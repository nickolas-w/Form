<h2>About Me</h2> 
    <p>Hi there. I’m 23 years old, and a native Wisconsinite. I’ve lived around the Stevens Point area my whole life, and I really like it here. This will technically be my 4th semester at the University of Wisconsin: Stevens Point, but will be my consistent 3rd one here. I had to take a few years break from school due to illness in the family. I’m excited to be back, and I’m hoping to become a Computer Information Systems major. I have minimal experience with coding, but with the experience I do have, I  really enjoy website development. I intend to continue down that avenue for my career.</p>

	<p>I live with my girlfriend and cat in an apartment. Some of my hobbies include video games, movies, and heraldry. I will definitely elaborate on each of these throughout my website. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you have a great day!</p>
