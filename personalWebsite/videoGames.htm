<h2>Video Games</h2> 
	<p>Video games have been a huge part of my life. For better or worse, they were a sole source of entertainment for many years. I do believe that they are a valuable art form. I think what sometimes really holds them back, is the persisting stigma that they are "just for kids," and therefore can't really go into very deep topics. Also, I think at times, that some developers add certain elements to a game simply because "games of this genre always have these elements." I think some deviation would be great for the market. However, I don't have any real training or anything to substantiate this, so let's just call it the opinions of some random guy. Anyway, some of my favorite games, in random order, would be Final Fantasy Tactics, Metal Gear Solid 3, Final Fantasy X, Super Punch-Out!!, Super Mario World, and Undertale.</p>
