<h2>My Family</h2> 
    <p>I have been living with my girlfriend, Angela, for 2 and a half years now. We’ve actually known each other a lot longer, having accidently met online. In total, we’ve been together for 7 years now. It honestly doesn’t feel that long, but at the same time, I can’t really remember life without her. Of course, we have our ups and down, but we always come through at the end. I wouldn’t give her up for anything.</p>
	<p>We have a cat. Her name is Adina (pronounced A-dee-na). She is a beautiful American Shorthair Brown Tabby. She is definitely an individual. She’s almost always so sweet, and I love her a lot. I don’t like it so much when she wakes me up at 5 in the morning making all kinds of noise, but I can put up with that. I also wouldn’t give her up for anything.</p>
